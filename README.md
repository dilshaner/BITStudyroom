# Your Self-Study Partner for Bachelor of IT

Welcome to **Your Self-Study Partner for Bachelor of IT** 🎓  

This project was started with the goal of creating a place where students could **share knowledge** with each other while learning — completely free. The idea was to make self-study easier, collaborative, and accessible to anyone pursuing a **Bachelor of IT** degree.
