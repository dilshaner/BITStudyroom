{"/about/":{"data":{"":"Hextra is designed to be a simple, fast, and flexible theme for building modern static websites. It is especially well-suited for documentation websites but can also be used for various types of sites, such as blogs, portfolios, and more.\nHugo, like Jekyll, is a static site generator. What sets Hugo apart is that it is a single binary, making it easy to install and run on various platforms. It is also extremely fast and reliable, capable of rendering a site with thousands of pages in milliseconds.\nHextra is built with a mindset focused on having a minimal footprint. To get started, no extra dependencies like Node.js packages are required; all you need is a single YAML configuration file, along with your Markdown content. Thus, we can focus on writing quality content instead of setting up tooling.","credits#Credits":"Hextra cannot be built without the following tools and inspirations:\nHugo Tailwind CSS Heroicons Nextra Next.js "},"title":"About"},"/announcements/":{"data":{"":" July 3, 2025, 3:43 PM By: Prof. Jane Smith The lecture on \"Positive and Negative Integers\" has been rescheduled to July 5, 2025, at 10:00 AM.
